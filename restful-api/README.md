## 📘 Introduction

In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential.

This project explores **RESTful APIs** — a foundational concept in modern web services. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of architectural constraints that makes communication between systems scalable, stateless, and cacheable.

RESTful APIs enable seamless integration between applications, making services widely accessible and interoperable.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### 🔗 HTTP/HTTPS Basics
- Understand how the web transfers data
- Explore HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Learn the difference between HTTP and HTTPS

### 🖥️ API Consumption via Command Line
- Use `curl` to make API requests
- Handle headers and inspect responses

### 🐍 API Consumption with Python
- Use `requests` module to interact with APIs
- Parse JSON and manipulate response data

### 🔧 API Development with `http.server`
- Learn how to build basic APIs using Python’s built-in tools

### ⚙️ API Development with Flask
- Create RESTful endpoints
- Route requests and return JSON
- Scale up API projects using Flask

### 🔐 API Security & Authentication
- Understand basic API authentication methods (e.g., tokens, headers)
- Learn how to protect data and endpoints

### 📄 API Standards & Documentation with OpenAPI
- Document your API properly using OpenAPI (Swagger)
- Improve maintainability and team collaboration

## 🌍 Importance of RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs are the **backbone of digital communication**. From social networks to IoT systems, APIs connect the dots between services and data. Mastering REST means mastering integration — a crucial skill in today's tech ecosystem.

```

### 🔍 Components

- **Client**: Browser, app, or service making the request
- **Web Server**: Handles incoming traffic, forwards to API
- **API Server**: Contains logic to process requests and responses
- **Database**: Stores and retrieves necessary data

### 🔁 Flow

1. Client sends HTTP request to Web Server
2. Web Server forwards it to API Server
3. API Server processes and interacts with Database
4. API Server returns response to Web Server
5. Web Server sends response back to Client

> In smaller projects, the Web and API server may be a single unit. This separation becomes useful in large-scale applications for better performance and maintainability.

## 🚀 Get Started

To begin this project:
1. Install tools like `curl` and `Python 3.x`
2. Try making basic requests to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
3. Gradually move from API consumers to API creators (Flask!)
