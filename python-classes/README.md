<h1 align="center">Python - Classes and Objects</h1>

## üìå Description
This project explores the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, focusing on the creation and manipulation of classes and objects. The goal is to understand the principles of OOP, including:

- Classes and Instances
- Attributes (Public, Protected, Private)
- Methods and the `self` keyword
- Constructor (`__init__` method)
- Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Properties vs Getters and Setters
- Dynamically adding attributes
- Attribute binding to objects and classes
- The `__dict__` attribute
- Usage of `getattr`

## üìö Resources

The following resources are recommended for better understanding:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
- [Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
